## 1. Overview
SWAYPAY aims to offer payment solutions catering to both DAOs and Individuals. Our primary target audience consists of FUEL users seeking seamless payroll, funding, and vesting solutions. By providing these services, we strive to contribute to the growth and expansion of the FUEL ecosystem.

## 2. Key Features
### DAO Creation without Coding:
SWAYPAY enables organizations to effortlessly create DAOs by providing an intuitive interface for configuring DAO parameters, defining governance rules, and establishing tokenomics. This eliminates the complexities of coding, making it accessible to a broader range of users.
### Transparent Governance with Voting Mechanism:
Within each DAO, SWAYPAY allows users to propose Payouts and Funding requests. The community participates in a democratic voting process to approve or reject these proposals, ensuring transparency and effective fund management.
### Seamless Payments and Payouts:
SWAYPAY facilitates seamless payments to individual users and other DAOs, both internally and externally. This feature fosters collaboration and financial interactions within the FUEL ecosystem.
### Crypto Streaming:
SWAYPAY introduces Crypto streaming, a cutting-edge feature that enables real-time payments based on continuous streams of funds. This dynamic payment method suits various use cases, such as subscription-based services.
### Payment Channels for Efficiency:
Leveraging Payment channels, SWAYPAY ensures near-instantaneous and cost-effective transactions for users. By reducing gas fees, this feature is especially advantageous for microtransactions and frequent transfers.
### Decentralized Contract Architecture: 
Each DAO, Crypto Stream, or Payment Channel in SWAYPAY is deployed as a separate contract on the FUEL testnet. This decentralized architecture ensures enhanced security and mitigates risks, as no central contract holds all the funds.
